<h1>KIWIJAM 2022</h1>
<p>
<h2>Description</h2>
This game was made in a group of 5 in the New Zealand Kiwijam game jam. We had two days to produce a game. The theme for our game was "Together".
The game we decided on was a side scrolling puzzle plateformer in this the player is accompanied by a ghost companion the player can switch between the 
two modes as the main character and the ghost the ghost can achive certain things that the player cannot. 

<h4>What I Learnt</h4>
This game was my first introduction to both Unity and working in a group outside of classes. This taught me the problems that arrise using Git specifically merge conflicts. The team also struggled with creative differences towards the game we were producing. All round it was very educational experience to
work with people in different specializations to produce a single product we are all happy and proud of. Being most peoples first gamejam we struggled to complete much of the project.

<h6>Note to self: May return to this idea in the future fopr further development</h6>
