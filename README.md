# Kiwijam
This game was made in a group of 5 in the New Zealand Kiwijam game jam. We had two days to produce a game. The theme for our game was "Together".
The game we decided on was a side scrolling puzzle plateformer in this the player is accompanied by a ghost companion the player can switch between the 
two modes as the main character and the ghost the ghost can achive certain things that the player cannot. 
This game was my first introduction to both Unity and working in a group. This taught me the problems that arrise using Github merge conflicts and
creative differences towards the game we were producing as well as the basics of unity development. All round it was very educational experience to
work with people in different fields to produce a single product. Of course it was a gamejam with limited time so we didn't get a lot completed.
Note to self: May return to this idea in the future
